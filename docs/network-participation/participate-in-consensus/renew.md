title: Renew Participation Keys

You can renew a participation key anytime before it expires, and we recommend to do it at least two weeks (about 38,400 rounds) in advance. The validity ranges of participation keys can overlap. For any account, at any time, at most one participation key is registered, namely the one included in the latest online key registration transaction for this account.

	An online or offline key registration actually takes effect 320 rounds after the transaction is committed to the blockchain.
