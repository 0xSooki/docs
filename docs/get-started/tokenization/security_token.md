title: Create a security token

!!! important
    This guide is meant to demonstrate what is _technically_ possible on Algorand. It should _not_ be used to determine whether or not something should be considered a security. Many of these features are applicable outside of regulatory use cases.

# What are security tokens?

Security tokens, or restricted assets, are assets that require certain centralized control mechanisms. For example, if the asset youâ€™re issuing is a U.S. security, you may need ways to comply with Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations and this may take the form of having the ability to freeze or clawback those tokens in the case of fraud. 

Having centralized control mechanisms on an asset may sound contradictory to everything we have talked about so far. Why use a decentralized blockchain if you want to exert some type of centralized control over an asset? To answer that question, we should revisit the [blockchain basics section](../../basics/what_is_blockchain/#how-will-blockchain-benefit-my-application) and remember that there are many properties (like **low costs**, **efficiency**, and **composability**) that offer significant improvements for some legacy systems.

So how can we solve for this use case without encroaching on the promise of decentralization for the rest of the ecosystem? Algorand does this by offering several optional-to-use configuration settings on Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs). Specifically, when you create an ASA, you can specify a manager, reserve, freeze, and clawback address, OR you can leave any or all of them blank, which the protocol will interpret as immutable from that point forward.  Embedding this configuration option within the broader decentralized and transparent Algorand ecosystem, offers users a choice to stick with assets that have no central control mechanisms, or to trust a specific issuer knowing exactly the type of control they have over the asset.

# How to create security tokens
Creating security tokens is the same as creating NFTs or FTs, with the extra configuration settings specified. Run the accompanying code in your favorite SDK to see an example of using the freeze and clawback capabilities.
